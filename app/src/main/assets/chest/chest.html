<h2 id="Crunches">1.Dumbbell Bench Press</h2>

<p><strong><em>Dumbbell Bench Press Instructions</em></strong><strong style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.</li>
   <li> Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.</li>
    <li>Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position.</li>
    <li>Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.</li>
    <li>Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Caution</em></strong><strong style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.

Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor.</p>

<p><strong><em>Variations:</em></strong><strong style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other.

Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body.</p>

<div style="float:right;">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Once you get used to the regular crunches, modify the basic crunch to get an even more effective tummy exercise.</p>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.</li>
<li>Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width.</li>
<li>Once you have the dumbbells raised to shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you.This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>Be sure to keep full control of the dumbbells at all times.  Then breathe out and push the dumbbells up with your chest.</li>
<li>Lock your arms at the top, hold for a second, and then start slowly lowering the weight. Tip Ideally, lowering the weights should take about twice as long as raising them.</li>
<li>Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li>
<li>When you are done, place the dumbbells back on your thighs and then on the floor.  This is the safest manner to release the dumbbells.</li>
</ol>
</p><p><strong>Variations:</strong> You can use several angles on the incline bench if the bench you are using is adjustable.</p><p>Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other.</p><p>Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body.  I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.</p>

<li>To move into the starting position, place the pulleys at the low position, select the resistance to be used and grasp a handle in each hand.</li>
<li>Step forward, gaining tension in the pulleys. Your palms should be facing forward, hands below the waist, and your arms straight. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>With a slight bend in your arms, draw your hands upward and toward the midline of your body. Your hands should come together in front of your chest, palms facing up. </li>
<li>Return your arms back to the starting position after a brief pause. </li></ol>
      

<h2 id="ReverseCrunches">4.Decline Dumbbell Flyes :</h2>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to do reverse crunches. This is another good exercise to reduce belly fat.</p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_230481" style="width: 610px">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="content_4.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 92px;" /> <a href="http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/5-exercises-and-5-foods-to-reduce-belly-fat/" rel="attachment wp-att-230481"><span class="imgshare_buttons"> </span></a></p>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs.The palms of your hand will be facing each other.</li>
<li> Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width.  The palms of the hands should be facing each other and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor and fully extended. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li> With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest.  Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.  <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.</li>
<li> Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out.  <strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.</li>
<li> Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p><strong>Variation:</strong> You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation.</p>
